Narrated Abu Sa`id:

`Ali sent a piece of gold to the Prophet (ﷺ) who distributed it among four persons: Al-Aqra' bin H`Abis Al-Hanzali from the tribe of Mujashi, 'Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, Zaid at-Ta'i who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani Nahban, and 'Alqama bin Ulatha Al-`Amir who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani Kilab. So the Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, "He (i.e. the Prophet, ) gives the chief of Najd and does not give us." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "I give them) so as to attract their hearts (to Islam)." Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) and said, "Be afraid of Allah, O Muhammad!" The Prophet (ﷺ) ' said "Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of the earth to me while, you do not trust me?" Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested the Prophet (ﷺ) to let him chop that man's head off, but he prevented him. When the man left, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the Qur'an but the Qur'an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the religion as an arrow goes through the game's body. They will kill the Muslims but will not disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time' I will kill them as the people of 'Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them)."

Praise be to Allaah ﷻ!

Imam Ibn Munzur (rahimahullah) writes in Lisan ul Arab:

محمد، صلى الله عليه وسلم، خاتِمُ الأَنبياء، عليه وعليهم الصلاة والسلام. التهذيب: والخاتِم والخاتَم من أَسماء النبي، صلى الله عليه وسلم. وفي التنزيل العزيز: ما كان محمد أَبا أَحد من رجالكم ولكن رسول الله وخاتِمَ النبيّين؛ أَي آخرهم

Translation: Muhammad (Peace be upon him) is the Last of Prophets (Salat and Salam on all), both the words Khatim and Khatam are names of Prophet, as is revealed in Al Aziz (i.e. Quran):” Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets; and Allah is ever Aware of all things” (33:40) THIS REFERS TO LAST/END (أَي آخرهم) [Lisan ul Arab, Under the letter “خ”]

Imam Ibn Munzur also said:

ومن أَسمائه العاقب أَيضاً ومعناه آخر الأَنبياء

Translation: And amongst the names (of Prophet) is Al-Aqib which means “The Akhir al Anbiya” I.e. The Last to come of Prophets [Ibid]

وإنه سيكون في أمتي ثلاثون كذابون كلهم يزعم أنه نبي وأنا ‏ ‏ خاتم ‏ ‏النبيين لا نبي بعدي ‏

Translation: The Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: There will arise 30 grand Liars (ثلاثون كذابون) from my Ummah, each of them will claim that he is the Prophet whereas “I AM KHATAM AN NABIYEEN AND THERE IS NO PROPHET AFTER ME (لا نبي بعدي)” [Sunnan Tirimdhi , Hadith # 2202]

Imam Tirimdhi Said after this hadith:

‏ ‏هذا ‏ ‏حديث حسن صحيح ‏

Translation: This Hadith is “HASSAN SAHIH”

The Hadith is also narrated in Sunnan ABU Dawud, Hadith # 4252

Narrated Abu Huraira:

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The Israelis used to be ruled and guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number." The people asked, "O Allah's Messenger! What do you order us (to do)?" He said, "Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e. the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah has put under their guardianship." [Sahih Al-Bukhari]

Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:

وَلَكِنْ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ

“but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets” [al-Ahzaab 33:40].

This verse states that there will be no Prophet after him, and if there will be no Prophet after him, then there can be no Messenger after him either, because the status of Messenger is higher than the status of Prophet; a Messenger is also a Prophet but the converse is not necessarily the case.

Tafseer Ibn Katheer (3/645).

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If he was the Seal of the Prophets then he was also the Seal of the Messengers for sure, because there is no Messenger who is not also a Prophet. Hence it is said: Every Messenger is a Prophet but not every Prophet is a Messenger. End quote.

Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (1/250).

And Allaah ﷻ knows best.

Narrated Abu Huraira:

Allah's Apostle said, "My similitude in comparison with the other prophets before me, is that of a man who has built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one _**_brick_**_ in a corner. The people go about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: 'Would that this _**_brick_**_ be put in its place!' So I am that _**_brick_**_, and I am the last of the Prophets."

حَدَّثَنَا قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ، حَدَّثَنَا إِسْمَاعِيلُ بْنُ جَعْفَرٍ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ دِينَارٍ، عَنْ أَبِي صَالِحٍ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ "‏ إِنَّ مَثَلِي وَمَثَلَ الأَنْبِيَاءِ مِنْ قَبْلِي كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ بَنَى بَيْتًا فَأَحْسَنَهُ وَأَجْمَلَهُ، إِلاَّ مَوْضِعَ لَبِنَةٍ مِنْ زَاوِيَةٍ، فَجَعَلَ النَّاسُ يَطُوفُونَ بِهِ وَيَعْجَبُونَ لَهُ، وَيَقُولُونَ هَلاَّ وُضِعَتْ هَذِهِ اللَّبِنَةُ قَالَ فَأَنَا اللَّبِنَةُ، وَأَنَا خَاتِمُ النَّبِيِّينَ ‏"‏‏.‏
