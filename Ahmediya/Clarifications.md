If our nabi (saw) is the seal of prophets, how Mirza can claim another prophethood. See the Biography, that he claims to be prophen in 1865, but only in 1882 became the promised Messiah. 

Find out some verses, about the life and death as we don't have 2 lives, instead one life on this earth, if we die then we will be given life back after the 2nd Soor. So, if Isa (alai) died (naoodhubillah), how his spirit came to Mirza, who died 2nd time. 
It only makes sense, Hazrath Isa (alai) will return to this world as expected and will have natural death as prophecised. 

Most of the revelations are through dream, but this one says verbal, wonder how. See => Biography: 1871 he receives verbal revelation "Therefore, he will soon be made well-known among the people" \[Tadkirah p20].
