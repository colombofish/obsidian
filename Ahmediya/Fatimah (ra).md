Miswar b. Makhramah reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:

_**_Fatima_**_ is a part of me. He in fact tortures me who tortures her.

حَدَّثَنِي أَبُو مَعْمَرٍ، إِسْمَاعِيلُ بْنُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الْهُذَلِيُّ حَدَّثَنَا سُفْيَانُ، عَنْ عَمْرٍو، عَنِ ابْنِ أَبِي مُلَيْكَةَ، عَنِ الْمِسْوَرِ بْنِ مَخْرَمَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ "‏ إِنَّمَا فَاطِمَةُ بَضْعَةٌ مِنِّي يُؤْذِينِي مَا آذَاهَا ‏"‏ ‏.‏

Once Rasul-Allah ﷺ asked a congregation of Sahaba _“What is the best thing for women?”_ They didn’t know what to say. Sayyiduna Ali came home and asked Fatima Radi-Allahu Anha, who replied: _“That they don’t look at men and men don’t look at them.”_ Sayyiduna Ali returned to the gathering and informed them. Rasul-Allah ﷺ patted his chest and proudly said: انها ابنتي _“Indeed she is my daughter.”_

Rasul-Allah ﷺ gave her the glad tiding of being the Sayyidah (leader) of the ladies in Jannah. [Bukhari]

Another Hadith mentions that an announcement will be made on the day of resurrection, _”O people lower your gaze! Let Fatima, the daughter of Rasul-Allah, pass through.”_ [Mustadrak Hakim]

Before her death, Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq Radi-Allahu Anhu came to her residence with Sayyiduna Ali Radi-Allahu Anhu and sat by her side from behind a curtain. He apologized for any ill feelings she might have had. He said to her:

‎ “والله لقرابة رسول الله صلي الله عليه و سلم أحب الي ان أصل من قرابتي”

_”By Allah! Maintaining the bonds of relationship of Rasul-Allah ﷺ is more beloved to me than maintaining the bonds of my own”_ She knew he was speaking from his heart and she was pleased with him.

She instructed that when her body is lowered in the grave, a sheet should be spread around, so her body can be curtained from the eyes of the congregation. This is where the covering of a female started when lowering her body in the grave.

'Urwah, Muhammad ibn ‘Ali, Aisha _radiya Llahu ‘anha_, and Yahya ibn Sa’id all narrate from Sayyidina Ibn ‘Abbas _radiya Llahu ‘anhu_ that Sayyidina ‘Ali _radiya Llahu ‘anhu_ buried her at night.
