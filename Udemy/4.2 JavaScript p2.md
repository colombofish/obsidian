##### Objects as variables 
var bellBoy1 = {
	name = "Timmy", 
	age = 19, 
	hasWorkpermit: true,
	languages: ["English", "French"]
}
So, we can use bellBoy1.name to access the name property in this object. However, suppose we need twenty bellBoy(s) all having same properties above. So, instead of creating 20 objects in the code, we can use a factory function or 
***Constructor function***. Ex below (note the f-n name capitalized not camelCase):
function HouseKeeper(name, workExperience, tasksToBeDone) { //Constructor f-n
    this.name = name;
    this.workExperience = workExperience, 
    this.tasksToBeDone = tasksToBeDone
} // initialize via
var houseKeeper2 = ***new*** HouseKeeper("Jane", 12, ["dish washing", "arranging kitchen"]); //this creates an obj houseKeeper2
To include a method to the constructor f-n above include the following among the above properties:
this.moveSuitcase = function () {
	pickupSuitcase();
	moveIt();
}
/*make sure to call the function with (), unlike properties. \[if a f-n is attached to an obj. is called method ] Ex: houseKeeper2.moveSuitcase()*;*/

*recollect the audio methods declared below to see the similarity wth abv factory f -n*
	var audio = new Audio('sounds/tom-3.mp3');
	audio.play();
	
***"keydown" eventListener***
[Event reference | MDN (mozilla.org)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
document.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
	console.log(event);
}); /*Note, that the f-n is passed with a parameter, which can be any such as event, e, evt etc. But, the passed parameter carries info abt the event that triggered this event*/
addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  handleClick(event.key);
})

*Passing functions as parameters / callbacks. Meaning a f-n take another f-n as an input*
example above the addEventListener is called Higher Order F-n. The f-n which is passed in is called a callback f-n.
*timeout callback f-n*
function buttonAnimation(currentKey) {
  var activeKey = document.querySelector("." + currentKey);
  activeKey.classList.toggle("pressed");
  console.log(activeKey.classList);
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("0.3 sec");
    activeKey.classList.toggle("pressed");
    console.log(activeKey.classList);
  }, 300);
}
