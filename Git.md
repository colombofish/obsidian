*Git Bash*
after installing with the default settings, open vscode, open terminal, and invoke GitBash from the dropdown menu from the terminal menu. You should see the $ sign. Now to link this bash to vscode do the following:

Command Palette -> Search for 'select default profile' -> select 'Git bash'. This will make the Git bash as the selected terminal.
In the command line a cool trick is to press 'Alt' and then can point the mouse where you want to edit the cmd. Other UNIX shortcuts like 'Ctrl' + a (to go to the start) or 'Ctrl' + e (to the end); 'Ctrl' + U to clear the line etc can be handy. 
'rm -r' this remove entire directory and all child folders etc.
