Important 2 things 1. Nahu نهو- is all about grammar; 2. Sarf سرف- is about how a word is spelt.  

3 kinds of words in Arabic:
**Ism**; F'il; harf. اسم, فعل, حرف
**Harf**: these are the words itself don't have sense. Ex: to, a, for etc similar to prepositions.
F'il: is a word gives in time (verb)
**Ism:** there r 2 definitions. 
1. if it's not F'il or Harf, then it's Ism :)
2. Ism could be a 'person; place, thing, idea, adjective, adverb & more'
most ideas can end with 'tion, ance, to eat, to cry, sleeping (not verb)', adjectives (the descriptions such as blue car, old house etc). 
ADVERBS are all the Ly's except Bruce & Love. Ex: nicely, beautifully etc. 
I seek forgiveness from Allah. Here, I (person), Allah (Being), forgiveness (idea) are Ism, seek is F'il and 'from' is Harf.

In English the noun coming at the beginning performs the action. Ex: Bob kicked Joe. However, in Arabic the actioner is specified by (peshu) 
However, the summary is 'U' does many things including being the doer; 
And 'A' does many things including being the 'done to'.

Every Ism has got 4 properties. 
1. Status; 
2. Number; 
3. Gender; 
4. Type
**1. Status** - below defines how to identify this. 
The doer of the F'il or details of the F'il goes into the 'Status Ism'. Sometimes, the word which goes after the word 'of'. 
Ex:
"Ustad taught us the Arabic of Qur'an slowly yesterday". 
Ustad - doer; what - Arabic; how - slowly; when - yesterday. Also where, why can be considered for the details of the F'il. 
**Raf'** (Rafa'a) note the doer is called Raf'. 

**Nasb** - detail of F'il is called Nasb. 
**Jarr** - the word comes after 'of' is called Jarr. Ex: Book of Allah, Messenger of Islam etc.
